This is the repository containing all assignments and projects for PHYS 664: Machine Learning for Time Series Analysis. 

This class is centered around the application of machine learning methods to various physics systems in astrophysics, biophysics, and more. Such ML methods and models will also be used to make predictions from these systems.

I chose to take this class to gain experience in using time series data as well as strengthen and develop my skills in machine learning. I hope to really master these existing skills, and learn new ones too, to better prepare me for the workforce after I graduate this semester. I am also eager to learn more about the situations in which ML skills can be applied. My relevant strengths include mathematics (calculus, linear algebra, probability/statistics, regression analysis). programming (Python, R, SAS, C, C++), and soft skills such as teamwork and efficency. I am also a hardworking student, and I never fail to put forth my best effort in my studies and seek assistance when needed. I am excited to be taking this course and I look forward to an engaging and productive semester.
